GOOD CAPITAL

1. Yes, We Took It
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Many years ago we hard-forked FacebookÂ¹ out of Libra.

2. To Realize the Promise of Good Capital
--------------------------------------------------------------------

We came to blockchain drawn by its early ideal: that capital could be unboundedâ€”independent, accelerating, transformative.

Letâ€™s be real: cryptoâ€™s walk doesnâ€™t match the talk. The more sophisticated projects seek absorption into legacy finance: banking rails, ETF wrappers, asset desks. The bottom of the barrel is famously dishonorable.

The public watches in confusion.

And yet, we believe something remarkable may have been uncovered along the way. What if these early systems were merely scaffolding for something more enduring?

We see a post-crypto digital asset: a universally accessible, liquid, lasting, high-leverage title to real human endeavor.

3. Rooted in a Principled Asset
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Prosperity does not arise from chance or math. It emerges from saving toward endeavors not yet realized.

Through OpenLibraâ€™s peer-to-peer experiments, participants have pledged, deferred, and redirected more than 90% of their earnings into forward-facing programs with initiatives that are both for the public benefit and economically sound.

$LBR is the title to all the games on OpenLibra, initially serving as seed capital for perpetual endowments for good as well as gain.

4. Which is Fiercely Independent
--------------------------------------------------------------------
We can make the right choices because we owe no one.

* Technically Sovereign *
We are not beholden to smart contract platforms designed with different goals. Our stack is our own and built to last.

* Proof of Labor *
There is no shell game, no empty cycle of promises. Outsized gains go to high impact contributions.

* Without Investors *
We have no exit to race toward. No quarterly metrics to chase. Our horizon is unhurried and vast.

* Untouched by Government *
Every $LBR was earned through mining. No pre-mine, no sale, no regulatory arbitrage.

* No Legal Wrapper *
We work without incorporationâ€”not out of neglect, but principle. Authority here is moral. Leadership is earned. Presence matters more than paperwork.

* No Predators*
We do not endorse capital games disguised as consensusâ€”schemes where early insiders earn endlessly while latecomers subsidize their position.

5. Grounded in Modern Tools
--------------------------------------------------------------------
A purpose-built Layer-1 blockchain secures the independence of $LBR.

Since 2019, weâ€™ve worked in the Move and Libra/Diem ecosystems; quietly, consistently, building institutional-grade infrastructure.

The result is a chain that supports smart contracts for anyone -- individual or institution -- wishing to store, grow, or distribute capital with intent.

We're here for capital, not trying to find use-cases for a database. We leave behind distractions and dead weight customary of legacy blockchains.

6. With Plans Measured in Centuries
--------------------------------------------------------------------

We are building across time with no end in sight. Not quarters or hype cycles, but generations.

Beyond the marketâ€™s churn, there lies a calm resolve: capital designed for interventions that matter by institutions not yet imagined and entrepreneurs yet to be forged.

We have the patience to build something lasting âœŠðŸŒž
